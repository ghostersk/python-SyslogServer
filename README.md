# python-SyslogServer
Python TCP-UDP Syslog server with SQLalchemy database as storage.
I have used it with Python 3.10.10

This Python Syslog server should allow constant storage of Syslog messages or any message received on TCP/UDP ports you define.
Data are stored in the SQLAlchemy database, what should be easy to change to any other SQL DB with updating the DB part.

I just need to find best way now to present the syslog data, read them. 
Hopefully I will find some opensource platform what will not limit me on amount of the data.
